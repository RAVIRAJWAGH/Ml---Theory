Method : Variance Threshold
Key Characteristics : Removes features with low variance.	
Pros : Simple and fast	
Cons : Only based on variance, may remove important features.

 
Method : Filter Method
Key Characteristics : Uses statistical techniques (correlation, chi-square, ANOVA, etc.) to select features.	
Pros : Fast, model-independent	
Cons : Ignores feature interactions and model-specific behaviors.

 
Method : Wrapper Method
Key Characteristics : Selects feature subsets based on model performance (Forward, Backward, RFE).	
Pros : High accuracy, considers feature interactions	
Cons : Computationally expensive, slow on large datasets.

 
Method : Embedded Method
Key Characteristics : Feature selection is integrated into the model training process (Lasso, Decision Trees, etc.).	
Pros : Efficient, considers feature importance during training	
Cons : Model-dependent, may not work for all algorithms.
